Today there is no shortage of website builders and frameworks users can choose from, like Wix and Webflow to name a few. But one thing they all have in common is that they take a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) approach, meaning users are required to have some degree of UI/UX design skills. Some services remedy this by providing templates and interactive guides, but users are ultimately responsible for optimizing their website's UI and UX. 

Blocky's solution is to instead take a WISIWIT(What I see is what I type) approach. Users only need to supply the content, like text and images, and assign certain attributes to them. Out comes a finished website, with optimized UX and everything. Think of it like Latex, but for websites.
